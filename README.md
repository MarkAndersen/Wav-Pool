# Wav-Pool

## Description

This app was created for the sole purpose of my making my girlfriend laugh. This is a front-end only react.js app, utilizing Material UI CSS API for styling, Fontsource for font styling and Use-sound to import and play the 'wav' files. user just click and a sound effect I recorded is played, simple as that. Styled for mobile first. I originally intended to host the sound files elsewhere, perhaps turn this into full stack application whereby sounds could be uploaded and buttons generated. This may a feature added in the future. The 'use-sound' NPM package was perfectly fine for this small scale usage.

## Usage/installation
type NPM i into CLI for package installation, 'npm start' to run locally

## Technologies Used
Javascript
Node.JS
React.JS
MUI NPM package for styling
